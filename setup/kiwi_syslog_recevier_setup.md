# Kiwi Syslog

Kiwi Syslog was used as a log receiver in place of Splunk Universal Forwarder as it is a lightweight, easy to set up solution for receiving logs send on Syslog protcol port 514. It allowed me to focus on log collection, parsing and visualtion without the added complexity of configuring individual log shippers or endpoint agents
